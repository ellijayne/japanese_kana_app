## Kana-o-Manabu!

Ruby version: 2.5.1
Rails version: 5.2.0

Welcome to Kana-o-Manabu (Learn Kana!)

This app is designed to help you learn the Hiragana kana set and get you on your way to ready some Japanese!

Visit the live site here :point_right: <a href="https://kana-manabu.herokuapp.com/">Kana-o-Manabu</a>

##Operating Instructions:
1. After you visit the page create an account, you can do this via the sign up form or authorize the app with Facebook.

2. After signing in you will be redirected to your homepage which contains links to your lessons. Click the lesson link and select which of the lessons listed you would like to take.

3. The lessons utilize mnemonics to help you learn the Hiragana. At first i thought mnemonics were a bit silly and not that helpful but after properly diving into them to learn hiragana myself I realised they're a very valuable learning tool. *the mnemonics used here are from the cool people at トフグ (Tofugu)*

4. Once you have scrolled through the lesson you can take a test on the Hiragana you have just seen. Once you enter your answers and click 'submit' the boxes containing your answers will turn red or green to indicate if you got them correct. Then you click to submit button again to submit your final answers!

5. You can review lessons and re-take tests as much as you like.

##Plans for the future

I realise the site is currently pretty rudimentary and people could cheat by changing their answers before submitting or they could keep mashing their keyboard randomly until they get the kana that matches the question kana without having to think about their answer - so i am going to fix all of that! I am working on having an English question that requires an answer in Hiragana and a Hiragana question that requires an answer in English so that people don't just mash their keyboard looking for the right answer. This will require some fine-tuning with the WanaKana English => Hiragana IME.

I am also working on a random quiz that lets users take a quiz where all the questions on Kana in the database have been randomised and may or may not relate to the lesson you just took.

Additionally, I am hoping to add a sketch pad to people can practise their writing skills on the website. I also hope to introduce a section for 'Typing Practice' that displays sentences written in Hiragana that the user must copy in order to practice their typing.

Another plan for the future would be to add audio clips containing the correct pronunciation of the Hiragana.

There are also plans to add Katakana to the app so people can learn those too!
